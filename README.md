# Fork info
This fork made to add 1.21.5 support of mod. [Original mod](https://github.com/nyuppo/hotbarcycle)
# HotbarCycle
Minecraft Fabric mod for Stardew Valley-inspired hotbar cycling. Developed for 1.19.

# Features
Adds 2 keybinds:
- Cycle Hotbar (Default: H): shifts the rows of the inventory downwards, allowing quick access to every row of the inventory without ever opening it.
- Cycle Slot (Default: J): shifts a single column of the inventory downwards (whichever hotbar slot you have selected).

**Additionally, there is Hold-and-Scroll mode:**
Instead of clicking a keybind to cycle the hotbar/slot, hold the button and use your scroll-wheel to cycle!

There are also config options for reversing the cycle order, enabling sounds, and enabling individual rows/columns for cycling through mod menu.
